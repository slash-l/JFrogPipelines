## Overview

This example demonstrates how you can build a Docker image and push it to Artifactory. The image built in this example can be used as a base custom image for Pipelines, since it fulfills all requirements listed in [the docs](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Choosing+your+Runtime+Image#ChoosingyourRuntimeImage-MinimumRequirementsforLinux).

For instructions on how to run this sample and explanation of configuration, please reference JFrog Pipelines Quickstart documentation: [Pipelines Example: Docker Build and Push](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Pipeline+Example%3A+Docker+Build+and+Push)
